So, finally gave CKA today. After being afraid of the exam as I lost consistency many a times in between. Intially I thought I'll definitely give it before Dec 22 (started in Oct 22) but with new year & other personal celebrations I kept it aside also because I didn't study for almost 2 weeks in dec. Then came Jan, the more I was delaying giving the exam the more scared I was. Finally scheduled it for 14th Jan but I since it was Madhu Didi's birthday I resheduled again for 21st Jan. After some more days I decided to give it on 22nd. I was having second thoughts on whether to give today or not because I didn't feel prepared enough, I decided to give anyway cause I was missing out on a lot of things because of this exam. Also, I committed to give it by dec and not fulfilling it made me feel guilty from inside. 

I'm just glad that I gave it today and it went well (let's hope for the result)

CKA experience:
1. The exam was not exactly tough. I finished it under 1:20 mins and I even revised all the solutions once again just to make sure.
2. Network Policy questions took me sometime
3. Sidecar question
4. K8s upgrade & etcd restore,backup went good
5. Edit the pvc after it is bounded and record the changes
6. RBAC clusterrole, roles & bindings
